# twitter-muted-word-list

## Introduction

This is a list of words to mute on Twitter for a more enjoyable experience, broken up into various categories. I don't take pull requests as it's my list, but you know, go ahead and change the words if you'd like to mute more things.

I don't know if blocking these terms actually does anything (I've seen varying results based on how you're using Twitter, i.e. app, browser, OS, etc), but if you have some space left, they can't hurt to add.

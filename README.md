# Introduction

This is a list of words to mute on Twitter for a more enjoyable experience, broken up into various categories. I don't take pull requests as it's my list, but you know, go ahead and change the words if you'd like to mute more things.

## Twitter Snake Oil
I don't know if blocking these terms actually does anything (I've seen varying results based on how you're using Twitter, i.e. app, browser, OS, etc), but if you have some space left, they can't hurt to add.

## Twitter Meme Templates
People who use these phrases on twitter are unlikely to offer you much original thought. If they do, I am willing to accept the splash damage.

I block this term because there are only 2 conversations about video game QA on twitter - that they suck, or that they're the best. I think they're the best.
